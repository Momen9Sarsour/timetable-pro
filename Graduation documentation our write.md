# **Introduction**

The timetable for the distribution of lectures in colleges and universities is an NP-Problem, where there is an overlap between times, halls and teachers. In which scheduling is using some tools such as Microsoft Excel, or as in Palestine Technical College, the aSc Timetables program is used, and this problem suffers from many universities in the Gaza Strip, not just the Palestine Technical College.

In this project, the genetic algorithm was used. The structured ideas of the algorithm operations that were the basis for genetic algorithms were first published by John Holland and his students in 1975 as a method for modeling biological processes for evolution. This simulates the process of biological development by generating a set of possible solutions, and evaluating them through Fitness Function, which evaluates each chromosome and its suitability to solve the problem and implements the Selection process, which is the selection of the chromosomes that will participate in the production of the next generation. The process of crossover is the process of integrating the genes of chromosomes fathers to produce new chromosomes, and the process of mutation, which is a random change in the chromosome genes. All this is done to produce better offspring in every cycle.

In this project, we develop a smart scheduling system using Laravel to automatically generate optimized academic timetables. The system considers multiple hard and soft constraints including lecture hours, instructor availability, classroom capacity, and time slot limitations. Our aim is to provide an automated, scalable, and conflict-free timetable generation system that reduces human effort, improves accuracy, and supports dynamic updates efficiently.

## **Problem Statement**

Academic timetable generation is a foundational task in the administrative operations of educational institutions. Despite its significance, it remains one of the most complex and constraint-laden problems in academic management, particularly as institutions grow in scale and complexity. In environments such as Palestine Technical College, which serves a large and diverse student body across multiple departments, the task of creating accurate, conflict-free schedules is both time-sensitive and highly error-prone.

Over the years, the college has relied on software tools like aSc Timetables to automate the scheduling process. While aSc provides a graphical interface and some automation features, it is fundamentally limited in several critical aspects. First, it lacks the intelligence to adapt to dynamic constraints — for example, when an instructor becomes suddenly unavailable, or a class needs to be moved due to maintenance or capacity changes. Adjusting the schedule often requires extensive manual intervention, which not only consumes time but also increases the likelihood of introducing new conflicts.

Furthermore, the system offers minimal support for optimizing soft constraints. Instructor preferences, ideal class distributions throughout the week, or classroom proximity are either ignored or difficult to implement effectively. This results in schedules that may be technically correct but inefficient or frustrating for faculty and students alike. aSc Timetables also struggles with scalability — as the number of variables increases, the system becomes less responsive and harder to manage.

Manual scheduling using spreadsheets or traditional tools exacerbates these issues. These approaches do not scale well, are heavily dependent on the individual experience of the scheduler, and fail to provide consistency or adaptability. They often lack mechanisms for automatically detecting and resolving conflicts, leading to overlapping classes, double-booked rooms, or inefficient instructor assignments.

Another critical limitation of existing methods — including aSc — is the inability to rapidly regenerate or repair a schedule in response to real-time changes. This rigidity becomes a major bottleneck during registration periods, unexpected closures, or staffing shifts, causing administrative delays and discontent among students and staff.

Given these challenges, there is a pressing need for a more intelligent, flexible, and robust scheduling solution. One that does not merely automate the process, but optimizes it — integrating both hard and soft constraints, allowing for dynamic adjustments, and delivering high-quality timetables efficiently. This project aims to meet that need by developing a smart scheduling system powered by genetic algorithms, capable of handling complex constraints and producing conflict-free schedules that adapt to institutional needs in real time. Such a system not only reduces human effort and error but also enhances operational efficiency, academic experience, and overall institutional responsiveness.

## **Objectives**

### **Main objective**
The main objective of this project is to develop and implement an intelligent academic scheduling system using Genetic Algorithms and Laravel framework to automatically generate optimized timetables for universities. The system aims to address the complexity of scheduling, which involves overlapping constraints related to lecture hours, instructor availability, classroom capacity, and time slot limitations. By simulating the process of natural evolution through selection, crossover, and mutation operations, the system seeks to reduce human effort, avoid conflicts, and enhance the accuracy and flexibility of academic scheduling. Additionally, the project aims to provide a scalable solution in Palestine Technical College Deir AL Balah, where traditional tools like aSc timetables software have proven insufficient.

### **Specific objectives**
- Developing and implementing a smart academic scheduling system that utilizes genetic algorithms to automatically generate optimized lecture timetables, minimizing conflicts between times, rooms, and instructors.
- Replacing the traditional manual and semi-automated scheduling methods used in PTC-DB —such as aSc Timetables—with an intelligent system that reduces human effort and improves efficiency.
- Creating a dynamic and user-friendly web interface that allows academic staff to view, modify, and approve generated schedules with ease and clarity.
- Designing the system to handle multiple hard constraints such as classroom capacity, instructor availability, and lecture durations, while also considering soft preferences like optimal time slots.
- Building a secure and scalable back-end using the Laravel framework to manage scheduling data and coordinate interactions between the algorithm, database, and user interface.

### **Importance of the project**

The importance of this project is to address the current issues with timetable scheduling in the PTC-DB by implementing a new system using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

This system solves one of the most complex and time-consuming challenges in academic institutions – the generation of conflict-free, optimized lecture timetables. Manual methods often lead to scheduling conflicts. By implementing a smart scheduling system based on genetic algorithms, this project aims to improve accuracy and reduce both hard and soft constraints.

Using genetic algorithms helps to find better solutions for timetable scheduling by testing many possible combinations and choosing the best ones. It can handle different rules and conditions at the same time, like avoiding conflicts and using rooms and instructors in the right way. This makes the system more smart and flexible than manual methods.

## **Scope and limitations of the project**

### **Scope:**

This project focuses on the development and deployment of a smart academic scheduling system for Palestine Technical College – Deir Al-Balah, utilizing Genetic Algorithms (GA) and the Laravel web development framework. The primary goal is to automate the process of generating optimal lecture timetables that consider multiple hard and soft constraints, replacing traditional manual or semi-automated tools such as aSc Timetables, which have proven to be limited in flexibility and responsiveness.

The scope includes:

- **Automated Schedule Generation**: The system automatically generates lecture schedules based on real institutional data, aiming to eliminate conflicts such as overlapping classes, double-booked instructors, or room clashes.

- **Constraint-Aware Scheduling**: The system is designed to respect hard constraints like room capacity, instructor availability, course durations, and departmental structure, while also considering soft constraints such as instructor preferences, balanced course distribution, and day/time suitability.

- **Support for Common Courses**: It handles subjects shared between multiple departments by properly coordinating the availability of rooms and instructors.

- **Web-Based Interface**: The platform includes a dynamic and user-friendly web interface through which academic coordinators can easily review, approve, and manage schedules.

- **Use of Genetic Algorithm**: By simulating evolutionary principles such as selection, crossover, and mutation, the system iteratively improves the quality of the schedules and adapts to changing data.

- **Scalability for Institutional Growth**: Although initially tailored for PTC-DB, the system architecture allows future expansion and adaptation to include more departments or potential branches of the institution.

### **Limitations:**

While the system offers significant improvements over existing scheduling methods, it is subject to several limitations:

- **Dependency on Data Quality**: The system's effectiveness is directly tied to the accuracy and completeness of input data. Incomplete or incorrect instructor availability, room capacities, or course requirements can lead to suboptimal schedules.

- **Computational Complexity**: As the number of courses, instructors, and rooms increases, the genetic algorithm may require longer computation times to find optimal solutions, potentially affecting real-time responsiveness.

- **Limited Real-Time Adaptation**: While the system can generate new schedules when data changes, it may not instantly adapt to sudden, unexpected changes during the academic semester without manual intervention.

- **Soft Constraint Prioritization**: The system may not always perfectly balance competing soft constraints, and the prioritization of these preferences may require fine-tuning based on institutional feedback.

- **Technology Dependencies**: The system relies on the Laravel framework, MySQL database, and modern web technologies, which may require specific technical expertise for maintenance and updates.

## **Genetic Algorithm Components**

### **1. Population**
In genetic algorithms, a population is a collection of potential solutions to the optimization problem. Each individual in the population represents a possible solution, encoded as a chromosome. The population evolves over successive generations through genetic operations like selection, crossover, and mutation.

In our timetable scheduling context:
- **Population**: A set of complete timetable solutions (chromosomes)
- **Individual/Chromosome**: A complete timetable solution containing all class assignments
- **Population Size**: Configurable parameter (typically 10-500 individuals) affecting diversity and convergence speed

The Laravel implementation manages populations through the `Population` model:
```php
class Population extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'size', 'max_generations', 'crossover_rate', 
        'mutation_rate', 'tournament_size', 'status'
    ];
    
    public function chromosomes()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Chromosome::class);
    }
}
```

### **2. Fitness Function**
The fitness function evaluates how good a solution is by measuring constraint violations and solution quality. It serves as the objective function that guides the evolutionary process toward better solutions.

**Hard Constraints (Critical - High Penalty):**
- Student group conflicts: Same student group scheduled simultaneously in different locations
- Instructor conflicts: Same instructor teaching multiple classes at the same time  
- Room conflicts: Multiple classes assigned to the same room simultaneously
- Capacity violations: Student enrollment exceeding room capacity
- Subject type mismatches: Theory classes in practical labs or vice versa

**Soft Constraints (Preferences - Lower Penalty):**
- Instructor preferences for specific time slots
- Balanced distribution of classes throughout the week
- Minimize gaps between classes for students and instructors
- Respect teacher preferences for rooms: Try to schedule lectures in teachers' preferred rooms
- Avoid consecutive lectures for teachers: It is preferable to have break periods between a teacher's lectures
- Avoid consecutive lectures for students: It is preferable to have break periods between a section's lectures
- Avoid empty periods between lectures: It is preferable to not have long empty periods between a section's lectures on the same day

The fitness evaluation in our system uses a penalty-based approach where lower penalties indicate better solutions:

```php
private function calculateFitness(Chromosome $chromosome): float
{
    $penalty = 0;
    
    // Hard constraint penalties (high weight)
    $penalty += $this->checkStudentConflicts($chromosome) * 100;
    $penalty += $this->checkInstructorConflicts($chromosome) * 100;  
    $penalty += $this->checkRoomConflicts($chromosome) * 100;
    $penalty += $this->checkCapacityViolations($chromosome) * 50;
    
    // Soft constraint penalties (lower weight)
    $penalty += $this->checkRoomTypeCompatibility($chromosome) * 10;
    $penalty += $this->checkPreferenceViolations($chromosome) * 5;
    
    // Convert penalty to fitness (lower penalty = higher fitness)
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + $penalty);
}
```

So we conclude that the fitness function is the core of any genetic algorithm.

### **3. Crossover**
Crossover, also known as recombination, is the process of combining genetic material from two parent chromosomes to produce one or more offspring. It mimics biological reproduction by exchanging segments of genes between parents to create new solutions that inherit characteristics from both parents.

There are different types of crossover methods, such as single-point, two-point, and uniform crossover, each differing in how gene segments are exchanged.

**1. Single-point crossover:** A random point is selected on the parent chromosomes, and genes are swapped beyond that point to generate new offspring.
```
Parent 1: A B C | D E F  
Parent 2: X Y Z | U V W  
→ Offspring: A B C | U V W
```

**2. Two-point crossover:** Two points are selected randomly, the segment between the points is swapped between the two parents.
```
Parent 1: A | B C D | E F  
Parent 2: X | Y Z U | V W  
→ Offspring: A | Y Z U | E F
```

**3. Uniform crossover:** There is no fixed point — it's a gene by gene choice.
```
Parent 1: A B C D E F  
Parent 2: X Y Z U V W  
→ Offspring: A Y C U V F (random mix)
```

**Crossover Implementation in the Project:**
In our Laravel-based timetable system, we implement single-point crossover:

```php
private function singlePointCrossover(Chromosome $parent1, Chromosome $parent2): array
{
    $genes1 = $parent1->genes->toArray();
    $genes2 = $parent2->genes->toArray();
    
    $crossoverPoint = rand(1, min(count($genes1), count($genes2)) - 1);
    
    // Create offspring by exchanging gene segments after crossover point
    $offspring1Genes = array_merge(
        array_slice($genes1, 0, $crossoverPoint),
        array_slice($genes2, $crossoverPoint)
    );
    
    $offspring2Genes = array_merge(
        array_slice($genes2, 0, $crossoverPoint), 
        array_slice($genes1, $crossoverPoint)
    );
    
    return [$this->createOffspring($offspring1Genes), 
            $this->createOffspring($offspring2Genes)];
}
```

### **4. Mutation**
Mutation is one of the core operations in genetic algorithms. It is used to maintain genetic diversity within the population and to avoid premature convergence to local optima. The mutation process involves introducing small, random changes to individual chromosomes (candidate solutions) to explore new areas in the solution space.

Typically applied after the crossover phase, the mutation is controlled by a predefined mutation rate, which determines the probability of a chromosome undergoing change. Common mutation techniques include shuffling a subset of genes within a chromosome, inverting the order of a group of genes, or swapping two randomly selected genes.

Selecting a suitable mutation operator is critical to maintaining the validity of the resulting chromosome. For instance, if a chromosome must contain all values from a specific set without duplication, randomly altering a single gene might create invalid solutions. In such cases, swap and shuffle techniques help ensure that the solution remains valid while still producing novel gene sequences.

As for the mutation rate, a typical starting point is 0.01, which provides a good balance between introducing diversity and preserving high-quality solutions. However, some problem domains have shown improved convergence speeds with higher rates, such as 0.2–0.3, though such rates may also lead to excessive disruption of good solutions.

**Mutation Implementation in the Project:**
In the genetic algorithm component of our academic scheduling system, mutation plays a vital role in generating diverse and innovative timetable configurations, helping to avoid repetitive or suboptimal results. We adopted several mutation strategies, most notably:

- **Gene Swap**: Randomly selecting and swapping two genes within a chromosome.
- **Gene Shuffling**: Selecting a subset of genes and rearranging them randomly.
- **Smart Conflict Resolution**: Identifying conflicts and attempting to resolve them through intelligent swapping.

```php
private function smartSwapMutation(Chromosome $chromosome): void
{
    $conflicts = $this->identifyConflicts($chromosome);
    
    foreach ($conflicts as $conflict) {
        $this->resolveConflictThroughSwapping($chromosome, $conflict);
    }
}
```

These methods were tested to ensure they produce valid schedules that do not violate essential constraints, such as overlapping lectures or assigning the same instructor to multiple locations simultaneously.

A mutation rate of 0.01 was adopted as the standard setting, offering a balanced exploration of the solution space without degrading the quality of schedules. Higher rates (0.2–0.3) were also tested but resulted in less stable convergence. Overall, the selected mutation techniques significantly enhanced the effectiveness of the scheduling process, enabling the system to deliver feasible and optimized timetable solutions tailored to the needs of Palestine Technical College – Deir Al-Balah.

### **5. Selection**
In the context of a Genetic Algorithm (GA), selection (also known as reproduction) is a crucial genetic operator that chooses chromosomes from the current population to participate in producing the next generation. This process is analogous to natural selection in biology, where individuals with traits best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. The primary goal of selection is to promote individuals with higher fitness values, meaning those that represent better solutions to the problem, by giving them a greater opportunity to reproduce and pass on their "genetic material" to the next generation. This directed search helps move the population towards areas of the solution space with higher fitness values.

**The selection methods:**

**Roulette Wheel Selection:**
This is a commonly used method for selection and it's based on fitness proportionate. It's like a roulette wheel where each slot's size corresponds to an individual's fitness, and spinning the wheel selects an individual.

**Tournament Selection:**
This simulates how sports tournaments work, where a number of players (individuals) compete to determine who is the best. It has a size parameter called Tournament Size: A parameter, k, determines the number of individuals participating in each tournament and this method we use in this project.

| Selection Method | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Roulette Wheel Selection** | The methodology is distinguished by its conceptual simplicity, readily comprehensible through analogy with a proportional lottery system. Furthermore, its inherent design facilitates the preservation of population diversity, as even individuals with lower fitness scores are not entirely precluded from the selection process, thereby mitigating the risk of premature convergence. | A primary limitation is its susceptibility to the influence of highly dominant individuals, whose exceptionally high fitness values can disproportionately affect the selection probabilities, thereby marginalizing the potential for selection of all other individuals. Moreover, the method is not inherently compatible with negative fitness scores, necessitating preliminary transformations to ensure the operability of the selection mechanism. |
| **Tournament Selection** | The implementation of this technique is notably straightforward, circumventing the need for the complex arithmetical computations associated with alternative methods. It provides a direct means of regulating the selection pressure through the modulation of the tournament size (k). Additionally, the procedure is computationally efficient, as it obviates the necessity for a complete sort of the entire population. | A notable drawback is the potential for diminished population diversity, particularly when a larger tournament size (k) is employed, as this diminishes the competitive opportunities for individuals with lesser fitness. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of the initial sampling introduces an element of chance, such that even individuals of high fitness may not consistently be presented with the opportunity to be selected. |

**Tournament Selection Implementation:**
```php
private function tournamentSelection(Collection $chromosomes, int $tournamentSize): Chromosome
{
    $tournament = $chromosomes->random($tournamentSize);
    return $tournament->sortByDesc('fitness_score')->first();
}
```

## **State of the art/review of related works**

The field of academic timetable scheduling has witnessed significant progress with the application of evolutionary algorithms, where several pioneering studies have presented innovative solutions to address complexity and multi-constraint challenges. In this context, three key studies have formed a crucial foundation for subsequent developments:

### **1. tsuGA Automated Scheduling System (Lim & Mammi, 2021)**

Lim and Mammi (2021) introduced an integrated system (tsuGA) for timetable scheduling at the School of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, based on genetic algorithms. The research focused on solving the manual scheduling problem that previously consumed days and significant human effort. The system featured:

- **3D chromosome representation** integrating courses, rooms, and timeslots
- **Fitness function** based on avoiding conflicts across three hard constraints: lecturer conflicts, room conflicts, and compulsory course conflicts
- **Integrated web system** enabling data management and automatic timetable generation
- **Practical results** achieving 93% conflict-free timetables while reducing generation time from days to 5.5 minutes on average

Despite its effectiveness, the system remained limited in handling elective courses, where some conflicts persisted.

### **2. Evolutionary Algorithm for Academic Timetabling (Abduljabbar & Abdullah, 2022)**

Abduljabbar and Abdullah (2022) developed an advanced evolutionary algorithm for course scheduling at the University of Technology, Baghdad, emphasizing flexibility in generating multiple solutions. The research featured:

- **Innovative binary chromosome representation** (24-bit) covering departments, classes, rooms, lecturers, and times
- **Multi-constraint criteria** including hard constraints (conflict avoidance) and soft constraints (lecture distribution preferences)
- **Single-point crossover mechanism** with guided mutation to enhance genetic diversity
- **Interactive system** enabling creation of modifiable alternative timetables per user requirements

Results demonstrated the system's capability to generate multiple timetables meeting changing requirements, though it faced challenges handling complex constraints in large colleges.

### **3. Integrated Cloud-Based Scheduling System (East, 2019)**

East (2019) presented a comprehensive solution based on genetic algorithms with an advanced service-oriented architecture, designed for cloud deployment. The system featured:

- **Three-tier architecture**: data service, algorithm service, and interactive web interface
- **Dynamic constraint standards** adaptable to different university requirements
- **Modern user interface** built on React with direct modification capabilities
- **Advanced selection mechanisms** resembling Roulette Wheel with elitism preservation
- **Scalability** through service deployment on cloud platforms

The system achieved high efficiency in generating conflict-free timetables but required improvements in handling soft constraints and user preferences.

### **Analysis of Strengths and Research Gaps**

These studies reveal notable progress in applying evolutionary algorithms to timetable scheduling, with shared strengths in:

- Utilizing innovative chromosome representations suited to the problem's nature
- Developing effective fitness functions for handling hard constraints
- Designing practical systems applicable in real academic environments

However, research gaps remain in:

- **Limited soft constraint optimization**: Most systems focus primarily on hard constraints
- **Scalability challenges**: Performance degradation with larger institutional data sets
- **Real-time adaptability**: Limited capability to handle dynamic changes during operation
- **User experience**: Need for more intuitive interfaces for non-technical users

Our project addresses these gaps by implementing a comprehensive Laravel-based system with enhanced soft constraint handling, optimized performance for large-scale deployment, and user-friendly interfaces designed for academic administrators.

## **System Architecture**

### **Architecture Overview**

The Timetable Management System follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern using the Laravel framework, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maintainable code structure. The system is designed with a multi-layered architecture that promotes scalability, security, and maintainability.
