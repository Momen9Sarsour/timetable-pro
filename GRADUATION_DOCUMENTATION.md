## Project Overview

### Project Title
**Timetable Management System with Genetic Algorithm Optimization**

### Project Description
This project is a comprehensive web-based timetable management system designed for universities and educational institutions. The system utilizes advanced genetic algorithms to automatically generate optimal class schedules while considering multiple constraints such as instructor availability, room capacity, time conflicts, and academic requirements.

### Problem Statement
Manual timetable creation in educational institutions is a complex, time-consuming process that often results in conflicts and suboptimal resource utilization. Traditional scheduling methods struggle to handle the numerous constraints and variables involved in academic scheduling.

### Solution Approach
The system implements a genetic algorithm-based approach to solve the timetable scheduling problem, treating each possible schedule as a chromosome and evolving optimal solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation operations.

### Key Objectives
- Automate the complex process of timetable generation
- Minimize scheduling conflicts (instructor, student, room)
- Optimize resource utilization
- Provide flexible configuration options
- Offer multiple visualization formats
- Ensure scalability for large institutions

## Genetic Algorithm Implementation

### Algorithm Overview
The genetic algorithm treats timetable scheduling as an optimization problem where:
- **Individual/Chromosome**: Complete timetable solution
- **Gene**: Single class assignment (section + instructor + room + timeslot)
- **Population**: Collection of possible timetable solutions
- **Fitness**: Quality measure based on constraint violations

### Algorithm Flow

#### 1. Initialization
```php
// Load all required data
$sections = Section::with('planSubject', 'instructors')->get();
$instructors = Instructor::with('subjects')->get();
$rooms = Room::with('roomType')->get();
$timeslots = Timeslot::all();

// Create initial population
$population = $this->createInitialPopulation($populationSize);
```

#### 2. Fitness Evaluation
The fitness function penalizes various constraint violations:
- **Student Group Conflicts**: Same student group in multiple places
- **Instructor Conflicts**: Same instructor teaching multiple classes
- **Room Conflicts**: Multiple classes in same room
- **Capacity Violations**: Students exceeding room capacity
- **Room Type Mismatches**: Theory classes in practical rooms

#### 3. Selection Process
Tournament selection chooses parents based on fitness:
```php
private function tournamentSelection(Collection $chromosomes, int $tournamentSize): Chromosome
{
    $tournament = $chromosomes->random($tournamentSize);
    return $tournament->sortBy('fitness')->first();
}
```

#### 4. Crossover Operation
Single-point crossover combines two parent solutions:
```php
private function singlePointCrossover(Chromosome $parent1, Chromosome $parent2): array
{
    $crossoverPoint = rand(1, min($parent1->genes->count(), $parent2->genes->count()) - 1);
    // Exchange genes after crossover point
    return [$offspring1, $offspring2];
}
```

#### 5. Mutation Process
Smart mutation swaps conflicting assignments:
```php
private function smartSwapMutation(Chromosome $chromosome): void
{
    // Identify conflicting genes
    $conflicts = $this->identifyConflicts($chromosome);
    // Attempt to resolve through intelligent swapping
    $this->resolveConflictsThroughSwapping($chromosome, $conflicts);
}
```

### Algorithm Parameters
- **Population Size**: 10-500 individuals
- **Max Generations**: 10-10,000 iterations
- **Crossover Rate**: 0.0-1.0 probability
- **Mutation Rate**: 0.0-1.0 probability
- **Tournament Size**: 2-10 individuals
- **Elitism**: Preserve best solutions
